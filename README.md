Whack-A-Letter Game
-----
Whack-A-Letter is a remixed educational version of the infamous Whack-A-Mole Game using Vanilla JavaScript. I was inspired by Wes Bos’s Javacript30 whack-a-mole game and decide to challenge myself by using the Alphabet instead.
This game will be great for kids 2-5 years old learning the alphabet.

Currently Working On:
----

1. Getting sound to play onclick of each letter.

2. Logic for “if the player misses 3 letters within the allowed time frame, they lose the game.”

3. UI changes

4. Mobile Responsive
